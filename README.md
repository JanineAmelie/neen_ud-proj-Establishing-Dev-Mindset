Dear Neen a-month-from-now,

It's me, your past self. The first thing I want to tell you before I even continue this letter is:

## STAY CALM & DON'T GIVE UP.

This path that you've chosen is going to be challenging. It's not going to be easy. **Someone once told you that nothing worth in life having is attained easily**. You made this decision for yourself so now you owe it up to yourself to finish this. You have your reasons for going down this path, so every time you feel like quitting think of the motivations that led you to walk down this path.

#### Here's some advice for you when you get stuck:

1. **You are resourceful and good at Googling: ** I know that you're capable of spending hours just to compile a perfect folder of bookmarks full of articles and tips and tricks. You have your 'watch-later' list, your 'Pocket App' on your tablet filled to the brim with offline sites. Stay that way. Always keep hoarding all that information, stay thirsty for that knowledge. Now that you're stuck, go through that list of bookmarks and piles of books.

2. **You are persistent:** Yes, you may mope around for a while, but I know that you always get up after drying your tears but you have your limitations which is why it's important to....

3. **Maintain your growth-mindset:** This is the most important bit.  After reading that one article about "[Navigating the Ups and Down of How to Code](http://www.codeconquest.com/blog/how-to-navigate-the-up-and-downs-of-learning-to-code/)" this couldn't describe me, us... any better.  I want you to go back and always read that article when you feel stuck. I want you to **STOP** comparing yourself to others. You need to **STOP** thinking that just because you suck at Math and had low grades in HighSchool and College Algebra that you'll never Succeed as a programmer. I need you to **STOP** comparing yourself to people farther along. Just like in the article, you need to instead become obsessed with hard work and practice.

### You won't get anywhere until hard work becomes your first priority. Study and look forward to tomorrow.

#### The goals that I have set for myself and for you( dear future self) are the ff:

1. **Finish the UD FEND:** This may seem like self-explanatory but I really need to put this down in writing.
2. **Enter a career that is not stagnant, not oversaturated, and is constantly changing:** When you graduated after 4 years with an Art Degree, you interned and worked at 2 different game studios for 2 years as a 2D/3D graphic artist creating graphics for mobile apps. And every day, day in day out it was always the same thing nothing ever changed and you never were motivated to learn something new. Competition/layoffs were fierce because there was always someone willing to work for way less. Although I acknowledge that there are really great Graphic Designers out there, being one is not as rewarding as I first thought it would be. If you request higher compensation for your work, there will be thousands if not ten-thousands of others who are willing to work for less.  This is true for every field but I think it's even more so in a field that has become over-saturated with the amount of people in it.

#### Questions for other Front-End Developers:

1.)  Imagine this scenario: You are employed in a company that compensates very well, this is your first job as a Front-End Dev. The question is: **What happens if the boss gives you a problem that is way above your scope of knowledge/capabilities?**  What would happen if the deadline looms near, and despite googling, online courses, video watching, you were unable to solve the problem Because it's way too high level? Will you get fired immediately? How do you avoid this kind of situation? How do you communicate this to your seniors that it might be a tad too much for you?

2.) How often does a front-end who is employed in a company need to learn a new Framework/Library?

3.) Are you allowed to ask questions to your co-workers if you are stuck for hours and hours on a particular problem? Will this reflect negatively on your capabilities as a Front-End Dev? Will you get fired for this?

4.) How to avoid getting overwhelmed at the first day of your job as a Junior Front-end Dev?
